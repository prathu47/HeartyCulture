                <h4>Foundation for Plant Care</h4>

                <div class="para">
                    <p>Once we have committed to our chosen plant spaces and plant selections, it is a gift to
                        acknowledge that we now and maybe again, are local participants in the magic of photosynthesis
                        and its Divine results. Regardless of the geographic home of any Earth family participant, we
                        need to be aware of a few Universal aspects of plant care as a baseline to gaining practical
                        experience. Our approach to prepare, plan, diagnose and execute ongoing horticultural care is
                        directly related to simply prioritizing our attention to current environmental signs as they
                        come and go.</p>

                    <p>We all understand that there are seasons of the year that produce changes in temperature,
                        rainfall, wind, sun intensity and so on. Do you have a basic understanding of the seasonal
                        changes specifically to your area? If not, just look up the seasons for your area and even chat
                        with a veteran grower in your neighborhood. A good suggestion for new and experienced gardeners
                        is to create a simple seasons date chart near your gardening tools area. Refer and refer and
                        refer to your seasonal date chart, until the moment when seasonal changes and consistencies just
                        become a part of you. Sensing the onset of varying environmental conditions is good sign that
                        you will soon be tuning in to your plants genetic patterns and needs.</p>

                    <p>Daily monitoring and observing the natural shifts of our green friend’s characteristics is most
                        important. This wonderful caretaker type habit develops our ability to “read” the needs or
                        non-needs of plant care in that moment. For example, our plant seems to be shedding more leaves
                        this week than last. Next, we can go to our seasons date chart, then research the life cycle of
                        this plant and can then comprehend that leaf shedding is perhaps within this plant’s annual leaf
                        cycle.</p>

                    <p>Here are some basic plant care visuals we can do while daily monitoring and observing - look for
                        broken branches both big and small (get used to looking up in the canopies of tall growing
                        plants such as trees), leaves drooping (may be too much or too little water), slow growth as
                        related to potential (soil deficiencies, maybe soil compaction).</p>

                    <p>Diagnosing a remedy in regards to correcting plant suffering can be accelerated by always
                        considering that human made situations are very often the culprit for poor plant health. The
                        repetitiveness of cars driving over lawns would make an obvious diagnosis for turf decline when
                        monitoring and observing. However, would we be keen enough to notice a consistent hot breeze
                        from a machine blowing on sensitive landscape causing a ‘burned’ foliage look? How about a shrub
                        that never flowers like it used to but a newly built wall is now obstructing the sun it needs?
                        When the right plant is planted in the right spot, they do mostly take care of themselves; so be
                        sure to go to the human element when trying to troubleshoot what seems like a poor performing
                        plant.</p>

                    <p> A few more human possibilities - excess vehicle exhaust along a hedgerow (making the hedge lose
                        its shine), window reflection of the sun accelerating the sun's intensity (causing death to a
                        isolated vegetative spot), poor fruiting from a tree (pollinators in decline from habitat loss).
                    </p>

                    <p> Begin and maintain seeing yourself as a consistent, observant grower and watch your confidence
                        grow! What does it mean to be a grower? One description could be of a person that simply obeys
                        and implements the simple guidelines set down by Nature. With loving attention to plants backed
                        with light knowledge, the understandings of this field will be imbibed into our being. There is
                        an annual botanical rhythm, a harmony amongst plants and animals that can be part of our life’s
                        homework.</p>
